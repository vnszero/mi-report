This project proposes the development and integration of a Business Analytics module into a management platform aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction sector. This work aims to complement an existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tool, providing corrections, improvements, and additional modules. The methodology adopted was based on the Scrum framework, with bi-weekly sprints and task allocation tailored to a single developer. The proposed interactive dashboards and dynamic reports should enable an integrated view of operations and support strategic decision-making. It is expected that the project will contribute to the digital transformation of the sector, increasing the competitiveness and management capacity of the companies involved.
